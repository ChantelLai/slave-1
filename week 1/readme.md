# Week 1
## Work, examples, thoughts & inspirations 

I've started looking at Processing, trying to get an understanding of the what and how. I've looked a bunch of designers which use code and parametric/generative ideas in their work. One of the most interesting is 'Conway's Game of Life'. I love now something that has such simple starting parametres can be used to create things with such complexity. <br/>

I'm quite pleased with myself because I played around with processing and made a little abstract artwork. It's made me realise how underneath all the design software we use, there is code (obviously) it's just something I don't pay much attention to.
